When I started coding this project, I knew pretty much nothing about good software development procedures. So I don't
really have a good test system set up.

At this point, the only testing I have is to check if BUMPy runs without crashing (cli_tests), and that the outputs
are gromacs compatible (gromacs_tests). Feel free to use, but don't expect too much.
