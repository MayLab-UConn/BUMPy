--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General/semantic:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-come up with a funny name for the program
-add in README how area matching will be performed *** THIS IS IMPORTANT n***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In main:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-make function to check if input bilayer is large enough to get slices out of
 for desired shapes
-add descriptions in help text
-add informational display function for command line inputs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In nonrigid_coordinate_transformations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-junction_transform HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AT ALL, is probably totally broken
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In rigid_body_transformations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-atm, the default way to center the z axis is to take the midpoint of coordinate
 extremes. This avoids issues from asymmetric bilayers, but leads to some noise.
 Perhaps center based on 10 extreme points on top and bottom to even out.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In shapes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-make examples, we have a crappy one for now that doesn't match changes in the
 flowthrough that I'm trying to implement. Keep in mind modularity when making
 these functions.
-be sure to feature the monolayer splicing and scaling
-write autodetect_params

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In molecules:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Make function to select random slicing location for flat bilayer (given
 restrictions based on needed dimensions and flat bilayer dimensions)
-make area-per-lipid calculations
-make thickness calculations **** THIS REQUIRES SOME THOUGHT ****
-make write_topology_file function
-make write_index_file function
-make sorter function for residues within a leaflet

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Involving multiple modules/flowthrough alterations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TESTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My biggest error in the week of coding I've done so far is not preparing
testable units. For the future,
  a) build from the bottom up, so that everything can be tested as I go.
     What I did instead was built random parts, that couldn't be tested until
     I built the code that would populate the variables I was working with
  b) ACTUALLY DO THE TESTING

For this project, I have a list of functionalities that need to be tested, and
the order in which they should be tested. Most of the "testing" folder is
useless, scripts I started that never finished.
1. argparse
2. pdb reading
3. pdb string and organizational manipulations (renumbering atoms, resids, etc)
4. pdb slicing and splicing
5. pdb_writing
6. rigid body transformations
7. non-rigid transformations

THEN, look at top-level things like shape assembly and main, once the other
components are verified
