-change code so that z inversions take place prior to curved transformations
-make rigid body transformations class
  -move relevant curve transform methods to rigid body

-test everything, make tests reproducible, callable

-change z centering based on range to range average of 10 most extreme points

-random slicing selection, spherical and rectangular, based on needed dimensions
and flat bilayer box size

-automatic calculation of area per lipid in bilayer_pdb class

-MONOlayer slice (add option of lipid deletion vs scaling)

-add coordinate scaling in nonrigid transformations
