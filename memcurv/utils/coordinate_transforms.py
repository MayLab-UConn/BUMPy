''' Coordinate transformations that are to act on EVERY particle in a system.
    Program should be set up so that all exclusions, deletions, etc are
    processed prior to transformation.

    With that in mind,cylindrical and spherical transformation functions can be
    used to create full spheres and cylinders, half, or any completeness in
    between with careful determination of input bilayer size and desired radius.

    In addition, the cylindrical transformation function will be used to
    generate lateral junctions. Radial junctions require a separate function,
    as they depend both on the junction radius and cylindrical radius that is
    being connected.

    These transforms in each case lead to shapes pointing "up" from the bilayer.
    If the option for "outer leaflet" in some cases is set to the bottom bilayer
    leaflet, the flat bilayer will be inverted in the z direction prior to
    transform.

    Geometrically, the original bilayers will be centered around (0,0,0). For
    partial cylinders, spheres, etc, they will center around (0,0,+r) and wrap
    down. For junctions this is (0,0,+r_junction), with a gap at the TOP of
    r_cylinder, and tapering down at z=0 to a flat bilayer.
