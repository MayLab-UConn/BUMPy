A few simple bash scripts to check if the output of BUMPy can be used
to start gromacs simulations

To run, need gromacs in path

Start files include
-martini 2.0 topology (with a dummy particle implementation)
-mdp files

The script will automatically add header includes for martini topology
to the output topology from BUMPy
